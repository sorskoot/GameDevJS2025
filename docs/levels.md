# LEVEL BUILDUP FLOW (Design Progression)

## 1. **Tutorial Through Play – "No Words Needed"**

**Goal:** Let the player *discover* the mechanics safely.

- **Level 1:**  
  - Flat ground, no obstacles.  
  - Teach **movement**.  
  - Add the red crystal to collect.  
  - Maybe one small jump.

- **Level 2:**  
  - Flat ground, small gap.
  - Teach **jump**.
  - Add the red crystal to collect.

- **Level 3:**
  - Introduce the **Light/Dark switch**.  
  - Use platforms visible only in one state.  
  - Prevent death by putting spikes *beneath* but not in the way yet.
  - Add a short tooltip like “Press [LMB] to switch” next to an impassable gap.

## 2. **Simple Challenges – "Single Concepts"**

**Goal:** Isolate ideas. One mechanic per level.

- Level 4: Jump to a platform that’s only visible in *Light*.
- Level 5: swiching back and forth between light and dark.
- Level 6: Jumping back and forth between light and dark platforms mid-jump.

Give **visual cues**: maybe the crystals subtly glow in the correct state?

---

## 3. **Combining Elements – "Two Ideas Meet"**

**Goal:** Layer earlier mechanics into more complex puzzles.

- Level 7: Spikes that are hidden in Dark—force switching to see them.
- Level 8: Jump on disappearing platforms *while* avoiding spikes below.
- Level 9: Timed switches: you must switch mid-air *after* leaping.
- Level 10: Crystals that appear only in Light, while the path is in Dark.

Maybe include a message like:  
💡 *“Not everything you need can be seen at once.”*

## 4. **Challenge & Mastery – "You’ve Got This"**

**Goal:** Increase difficulty. Let them feel smart.

- Complex platforming with rapid switches.  
- Introduce light-only/dark-only zones.  
- Add moving platforms visible only in one state.  
- Create a “hub level” with multiple small puzzles using all mechanics learned.

---

## 5. **Finale – "Balance is Everything"**

**Goal:** A final challenge that requires *everything* they’ve learned.

- No new mechanics.  
- High-stakes precision jumps, memorization, and timing.  
- Maybe even a section where switching drains your energy (if that’s a system you add).

## 🗨️ How to Teach Without Breaking Flow

- **In-World Text Hints:** Use floating text or signs near the obstacle. Example:
  - ✨ *“Dark hides the way…”*  
  - ✨ *“What’s not there might be elsewhere.”*
- **Symbolic Cues:** Maybe light-state platforms have a faint glowing outline even when hidden, to cue the player.
- **NPCs or Statues:** Could give one-line riddles or poetic tips.

## 🧠 Bonus Tips for Jam-Friendly Design

- **Short Levels, Big Ideas:** Don’t make them long—make each one feel distinct.
- **Instant Restart:** Players will experiment more freely.
- **Save the Best for Later:** If you have a “big wow” mechanic idea, build toward it slowly.
- **Balance Difficulty:** Make the first half casual, second half challenging. It’s okay to let everyone *finish*—just make 100%ing it a real challenge.
