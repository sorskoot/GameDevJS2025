Prompt for image:
Minimalist 3D concept art, split screen with a sharp vertical dividing line down the center. Left half: Solid white geometric cube platforms floating adrift in a pure, deep black void background. Right half: Mirrored composition with solid black geometric cube platforms floating adrift in a pure, stark white void background. Exactly centered on the dividing line, straddling both halves, is a single, vibrant bright red cube, caught mid-transition (glowing slightly with subtle red energy wisps). Style: Abstract geometric, high contrast, clean lines, simple cubic forms, untextured solids. Color Palette: Strictly black, white, and bright red only. No gradients, no shadows, no complex lighting, eye-level perspective.
