# Game

-   The game is build using TypeScript.
-   Often there are singletons used for common classes. If a component is a Singleton; use that instance.
-   Make sure to comply to the [Wonderland Engine Guide](./wonderland-instructions.md)
-   The game uses a custom React implementation for Wonderland Engine, REACT-DOM is not used.
-   Everything, including the UI is rendered through Wonderland Engine.
-   We can't use any other 3rd party libraries.
-   Wonderland Engine uses ESBuild for building projects.
